# 📽️ Telling Visual Data Stories with Tableau! 📊

## Introduction
In the fourth and final project of my Business Analytics NanoDegree at Udacity, I was to work on a data visualization using a Kaggle dataset of Trending YouTube Videos in the United States.

Visualizations were done through Tableau Public. The data at the heart of this project was sourced from a Kaggle dataset,  it contained information on YouTube Videos that were on the "trending" list for at least one day.

But before the visualization was done, some cleaning had to be done on the Data! I did my Data Cleaning using Power Query in Excel, ensuring that the dataset was accurate and ready for visualizing to an end user.

🗓️ It's important to note that the data in question covers the period from November 2017 to March 2018.
